## Mono-Cycle

09/10/24 - Project definition for Monocycle created

09/16/24 - Monocycle are carefully selected for the major moving parts

09/24/24 - Schematic for the microcontroller created 

09/27/24 - DC motors and H-bridge motor driver were purchased and arrived for     
           implementation into the microcontroller for testing.
           
10/08/24 - Starting testing the basics movements (forward, backward, turnings left and rigth) using serial monitor.
           
10/15/24 - After all movement tests we could conclude that it passes all tests succesfully .
10/17/24 - Schematic is updated to include the new additions to the circuit such as:
           - booster module
           - HC- 05 Bluetooth module
           - type-C battery charger
           
10/21/24 - a booster module was implemented to boost our voltage to 10 V with 
           a voltage regulator,  and charger to keep the battery charged

10/29/24 -  staring the design of the project and materials selection for it.

11/04/24 - Implementation of an HC-05 Arduino Bluetooth module to control the 
           motors wirelessly with an application.
           
11/10/24 - Starting tests with the HC-05, configuring the serial of the module and the arduino.

11/13/24 -
