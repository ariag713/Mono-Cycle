# Mono-Cycle

## Description
  The monocycle will be a remote controlled unmanned vehicle (drone), that will drive on one wheel.
  Realistically the entire build will be a wheel with electronics in it.
  The drone will be able to balance on its own while stationary and in movement.
  The drone will be built in three main assemblies
  * The drive wheel
    * A ring gear with teeth on the inside of the ring and on the outside of the ring will be a layer of rubber or 3d printed filamnent (that has some spring to it)
    * The outside of the ring will have rounded edges to simulate a bicycle wheel. This will also help in cornering and turning
  * The drive housing
    * The drive housing is what is going to store all the electronic components that allow this vehicle to move.
    * The drive motor will rotate the tread around the drive housing to allow the drone to move.
    * It will also hold some support gears to keep the tread from slipping, and provide required tension to the tread to also prevent it from slipping
    * It will also house the gyroscopic actuator that will allow the unit to have controlled tilt
  * The load housing
    * for the final product, the load housing will be important for its practical usage.
    * The load housing will have the components required to keep the load balanced while the drone is in operation.
    * It will help mitigate the roll the load will receive upon acceleration and deceleration/braking.
