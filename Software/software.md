*Here is the list for the software*
# Software
- PC Software:
  * Arduino IDE:
    * The Arduino IDE is a cross-platform application used to write, compile, and upload code to Arduino boards. It features a simple             interface for writing C/C++-based "sketches," with a code editor, syntax highlighting, and a serial monitor for debugging. The IDE 
      includes a library manager for additional functions and simplifies programming by providing pre-written libraries and easy USB 
      uploads to the board.
      
- Mobile Software
  * Arcuino Bluetooth Controller
    * The Arduino Bluetooth Controller App allows wireless control of Arduino     projects via Bluetooth from an Android device. It 
      supports multiple modes, such as button, joystick, and terminal, enabling users to send commands to control motors, lights, or other 
      connected components. Ideal for remote control, robotics, or home automation projects, it simplifies Bluetooth communication with 
      Arduino using modules like HC-05.
