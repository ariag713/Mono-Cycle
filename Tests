Tests for Mono-Cycle Design:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1: Mechanical Functionality:  ----VERIFIED----
  Goal: Verify that the Arduino correctly controls the motor speed and direction based on input commands from the remote controller.
    * Given the monowheel is powered on and the controller is connected,
    * When a forward command is sent from the controller,
    * Then the motor should turn in the forward direction 
  Test Method:
    * Connect the Arduino to the motor and remote controller (bluetooth device).
    * Send a series of forward commands 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 2: Turning Radius and Control: ----VERIFIED----
  Goal: Verify that the monowheel can execute controlled turns in response to steering commands and ensure the turning radius is within design specifications.
    * Given the monowheel is in motion,
    * When a left or right turn command is sent from the remote controller,
    * Then the monowheel should execute a smooth turn with a turning radius that matches the design specification (e.g., 1 meter).
  Test Method:
    * Drive the monowheel in a straight path and then initiate turning commands.
    * Measure the turning radius and check for any signs of instability or delayed responses.
    * Repeat for both left and right turns.
    * When a sensor (e.g., gyroscope) malfunctions or a signal is temporarily lost,
    * Then the monowheel should either maintain basic operation or trigger a safe stop mode to prevent accidents.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 3: Bluetooth Connectivity and Stability: ----VERIFIED----
Goal: Test how the monowheel maintains Bluetooth connectivity and communication stability under varying conditions and potential sources of interference.
  * Given the monowheel is connected to a controller or device via Bluetooth,
  * When the Bluetooth signal is exposed to potential disruptions (e.g., increased distance, physical obstructions, or nearby electronic interference),
  * Then the monowheel should maintain a stable Bluetooth connection with minimal latency, no unexpected disconnections, and reliable data transmission.
Test Method:
  * Pair the monowheel with a controller or smartphone via Bluetooth in a controlled testing area.
  * Gradually increase the distance between the monowheel and the paired device, measuring signal strength and latency at regular intervals.
  * Introduce physical barriers (e.g., walls or metallic objects) and monitor any impact on connectivity.
  * Test in environments with potential interference, such as areas with Wi-Fi routers, other Bluetooth devices, or RF sources.
  * Log any disconnections, delays, or data transmission errors, and verify the monowheel's responsiveness during the test.
