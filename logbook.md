## Mono-Cycle Project

### **09/10/24**
- Defined the project scope and objectives for the Monocycle. Outlined the functional and performance requirements to ensure clarity of the project goals.

### **09/16/24**
- Major moving parts for the Monocycle were carefully selected based on durability, performance, and compatibility with the design specifications.

### **09/24/24**
- Created the initial schematic for the microcontroller, focusing on the basic circuit design to support motor control and integration with peripheral components.

### **09/27/24**
- Procured key components including DC motors and an H-bridge motor driver. These arrived and were prepared for integration and testing with the microcontroller.

### **10/08/24**
- Conducted preliminary tests on the motors to evaluate their basic movements. Using a serial monitor, verified forward, backward, left-turn, and right-turn functionalities.

### **10/15/24**
- Concluded the motor movement tests successfully. All directions and functionalities performed as expected, confirming the motors and driver were operational.

### **10/17/24**
- Updated the schematic to include new components: a booster module to regulate voltage, an HC-05 Bluetooth module for wireless control, and a type-C battery charger for efficient power management.

### **10/21/24**
- Integrated the booster module into the circuit to raise the voltage to 10V using a voltage regulator. Also connected a battery charger to streamline the power supply system.

### **10/29/24**
- Began the look-like design phase in Autodesk Fusion, focusing on creating a model that resembles the final product. Continued material selection for construction and assembly.

### **11/04/24**
- Implemented the HC-05 Bluetooth module with Arduino for wireless motor control. Wrote and ran code to integrate the L298N motor driver, enabling PWM control for precise motor speed adjustments.

### **11/10/24**
- Started configuring the HC-05 Bluetooth module for serial communication with Arduino. During testing, identified an issue where the booster module was not supplying adequate current.
- Planned to replace the power supply with a higher-current battery setup (6 AA batteries in series) to resolve the issue.

### **11/12/24**
- Designed the initial monowheel housing. After peer review and discussion, identified areas for improvement, leading to plans for redesign.
- Replaced the power supply with a battery pack of 6 AA batteries to meet the current requirements of the motor driver.

### **11/19/24**
- Decided to order and integrate a gearbox with the DC motor for improved speed control and reduced rotational speed. Initiated redesign of the housing to accommodate the new gearbox.

### **11/26/24 to 11/28/24**
- 3D-printed the monowheel housing into modular parts, allowing for easier assembly and troubleshooting.
- Started drafting the project report, documenting progress and insights. Planned to finalize it after the complete assembly and testing of the Monowheel.

### **12/03/24 to 12/10/24**
- Received the gearbox motors on schedule. Proceeded with final prototype assembly.
- Utilized the MakerSpace soldering station for precise and reliable connections during the final assembly.
- Encountered errors in the initial code during testing. Troubleshot and implemented corrections, successfully resolving the issues.

### **12/17/24**
- Fully assembled the Monowheel and conducted final testing. All tests were passed without issues, confirming the success of the project.
  - **Test 1: Mechanical Functionality** ---- PASS ----
  - **Test 2: Turning Radius and Control** ---- PASS ----
  - **Test 3: Bluetooth Connectivity and Stability** ---- PASS ----
- Final prototype successfully meets project goals and specifications.
